									<p>Common questions and answers for our organization</p>
								</header>
								<hr />
							<h2>Who is eligible to be a student with TTS?</h2>
							<p>Any student musician from 2nd-12th grade who has some level of experience on their instrument. Students who cannot normally afford lessons or live in communities with little to no access to music education will be given preference in admissions. </p>
								<hr />

								<h2>Who is eligible to apply to be a teacher with TTS?</h2>
								<p>Any musician who is in their senior year of high school or is in a college or conservatory is eligible to apply. Teachers must possess a high level of technical facility and musicality on the instrument that they intend to teach to our students. We are strongly interested in applicants who have prior experience teaching musicians under the age of 18.</p>
								<hr />
									<h2>What instrument classes are offered in the program?</h2>
									<p>We offer instruction for all standard orchestral instruments, as well as some jazz instruments. To see our current list of available teachers, check out our teacher profiles. If your instrument is not represented, contact us by sending an email to throughthestaff@gmail.com </p>

								<hr />
								<h2>How does TTS address student and teacher safety and security?</h2>
								<p> Our safety guidelines during our lessons include (but are not limited to): receiving consent from the students parent or legal guardian, introducing our teachers to our parents at the beginning of the student’s first lesson, and providing for clear paths of communication between students, teachers, and parents. All teachers will receive and be assessed on information about expectations and appropriate safety guidelines prior to their first meeting with their student. </p>
								<hr />

								<h2>How much instruction time will I receive per week? </h2>
								<p>Every student will receive a minimum of 1 hour of musical instruction per week. However, depending on your teacher’s availability, more hours can be added. </p>

								<hr />

								<h2>How long can I stay with my teacher?</h2>
								<p>The first Through the Staff cohort will run until the end of the Cov-Ed pandemic. Afterwards, we will open applications again at the start of each new school semester. </p>

								<hr />

								<h2>Can I have more than one teacher?</h2>
								<p>Out of respect to our teachers, we limit each student to only having one teacher so that their instruction can be as effective and clear as possible.</p>

								<hr />

								<h2>Can I pick my own teacher?</h2>
								<p>You are able to provide up to three teacher preferences on the student application form. Final student-teacher pairings will be based on personality, musical level, and teacher availability.</p>

								<hr />

								<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
								<p>Nothing! This program is completely free of charge!</p>

								<hr />
								<h2>If necessary, can I end my participation in the program?</h2>
								<p>Yes, we ask that  you please send an email at least one week in advance to your TTS teacher and to throughthestaff@gmail.com. However, because each teacher is dedicating a significant amount of time and energy into working with each student, we hope that all students can continue to take lessons for at least one academic semester.</p>
