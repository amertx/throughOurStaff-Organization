													French Horn player Nathan Bamberger has always strived to reach beyond his own limits. With only four years of playing experience, Bamberger was a member of the inaugural season of the National Youth Orchestra 2, as well as a featured soloist with the Vermont Symphony Orchestra. He credits these opportunities as the beginning of his pursuit of a professional career in classical music. While not from a musical family, Nathan had a love of the art form from a very young age. It wasn’t until he picked up a Horn for the first time that he truly understood how deep his passion ran. A native of St. George, VT, Bamberger always viewed music not only as a form of artistic expression, but as a way to connect with people beyond the small community that he grew up in. His drive and passion have led him to perform with some of the most prestigious youth music ensembles in the world, such as the Boston University Tanglewood Institute, and the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America.

Jakob Schoenfeld is currently a first-year undergraduate at The Juilliard School, where he studies with Greg Zuber and Markus Rhoten. He began his percussion studies at age 11 in Oviedo, FL, and later continued his studies at the Interlochen Arts Academy with Keith Aleo. Jakob toured with the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America in 2018 and 2019, performing in halls across the US, Europe, and Asia. Before those summers, he spent time at the Interlochen Arts Camp and the Verbier Music Festival as a member of the Junior Orchestra. Recent accolades of his include being named a 2019 winner in Classical Percussion for the National YoungArts Foundation and earning 2nd place at Great Plains International Marimba Competition. In high school, he was principal percussionist of Honor Orchestra of America (2018, 2019) and principal timpanist of the NAfME All-National Symphony Orchestra (2018). Jakob enjoys teaching just as much as he does playing!
